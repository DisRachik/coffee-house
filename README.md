# Coffee House Resource

Coffee House is a two-page website project designed for a coffee shop. The first page features
information about the coffee house, a small gallery, and a slider showcasing the most popular
beverages offered. On the second page, there is an implemented gallery of the establishment's
products, allowing users to sort items by categories. Users also have the option to view detailed
information about a specific product and calculate its cost based on size and additional
ingredients.

The web application is responsive, adapting seamlessly to screens of all devices.
